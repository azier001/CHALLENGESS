# 🗺️ Explorer's Path Finder

## 🎯 Problem Overview

The **Explorer's Path Finder** is a navigation function that helps an intrepid explorer traverse through uncharted wilderness territories. Using binary-encoded rules, the explorer can determine how many additional steps to take and in which direction to proceed on their journey.

---

## 📋 Function Specification

### Function Signature
```javascript
explorerPathFinder(currentPath, binaryRules)
```

### 🔧 Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `currentPath` | `Array<Integer>` | An array of integers representing the explorer's current path coordinates |
| `binaryRules` | `String` | A binary string that encodes the navigation rules to follow |

### 🎯 Return Value
- **Type**: `Array<Integer>`
- **Description**: The complete path array after applying the binary rules

---

## ⚙️ Algorithm Logic

### Step 1: Binary to Decimal Conversion
The function converts the `binaryRules` binary string into a decimal number, which determines the number of new steps the explorer will take.

> **Example**: Binary `"1101"` → Decimal `13` → Explorer takes 13 additional steps

### Step 2: Path Extension Pattern
Starting from the last coordinate in `currentPath`, the function adds new coordinates following an alternating pattern:

- **Odd-numbered steps**: Add 1 to the previous coordinate
- **Even-numbered steps**: Subtract 1 from the previous coordinate

---

## 📊 Visual Example

Let's trace through an example to understand the pattern:

### Input
- `currentPath = [5, 3, 7]`
- `binaryRules = "101"` (decimal: 5)

### Process
```
Initial path: [5, 3, 7]
Last coordinate: 7

Step 1 (odd):  7 + 1 = 8
Step 2 (even): 8 - 1 = 7
Step 3 (odd):  7 + 1 = 8
Step 4 (even): 8 - 1 = 7
Step 5 (odd):  7 + 1 = 8
```

### Result
```
Final path: [5, 3, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]
```

## 🧩 Pattern Analysis

### Alternating Movement Pattern
The explorer follows a zigzag movement pattern:
- ↗️ **Forward step** (+1): Odd-numbered additions
- ↙️ **Backward step** (-1): Even-numbered additions

### Binary Rules Impact
- **Larger binary values** → More exploration steps
- **Smaller binary values** → Shorter path extensions
- **Binary "0"** → No additional movement (path remains unchanged)

---

## 📈 Complexity Analysis

| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(n), where n is the decimal value of binaryRules |
| **Space Complexity** | O(m + n), where m is the length of currentPath |

---

## 🎮 Use Cases

### 🏔️ Wilderness Navigation
Perfect for simulating explorer movements through mountain ranges, where terrain requires careful step-by-step navigation.

### 🎯 Game Development
Ideal for adventure games where character movement follows encoded patterns or rule-based exploration.

### 📊 Path Analysis
Useful for analyzing movement patterns and predicting future positions based on binary-encoded instructions.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases to Consider

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Empty `currentPath` | Handle gracefully or throw appropriate error |
| `binaryRules = "0"` | Return original path unchanged |
| Invalid binary string | Validate input format |
| Very large binary values | Consider performance implications |

---

## 🚀 Implementation Challenge

Your task is to implement the `explorerPathFinder` function that:

1. ✅ Converts binary rules to decimal steps
2. ✅ Extends the path using the alternating pattern
3. ✅ Returns the complete navigation path
4. ✅ Handles edge cases appropriately
