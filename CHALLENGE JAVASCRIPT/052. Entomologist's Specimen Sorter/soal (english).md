# 🦗 Entomologist's Specimen Sorter

## 📋 Challenge Overview

**Difficulty Level:** `Easy`

As an entomologist working in a prestigious natural history museum, you've been tasked with organizing and analyzing a collection of insect specimens. Your expertise is needed to create an efficient sorting system that will help researchers quickly access specimens based on their sizes.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a function named `sortInsectSpecimens` that processes specimen data according to specific museum protocols.

### Function Signature
```javascript
function sortInsectSpecimens(specimens) {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

---

## 📝 Requirements

Your function must perform the following operations in sequence:

### Step 1: Size Adjustment Protocol
- **Increment the size** of every **third specimen** in the array by `1`
- This accounts for measurement variations due to preservation methods

### Step 2: Specimen Organization
- **Sort the array** in **ascending order** based on specimen sizes
- Smaller specimens should appear first in the collection

### Step 3: Return Results
- **Return the sorted array** with all adjustments applied

---

## 🔧 Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `specimens` | `Array<number>` | An array of numbers representing the sizes of insect specimens in millimeters |

---

## 📤 Return Value

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Array<number>` | A sorted array of numbers representing the adjusted and organized specimen sizes |

---

## 💡 Example Usage

```javascript
// Example input
const specimens = [5, 8, 3, 12, 7, 15, 2, 9];

// Function call
const sortedSpecimens = sortInsectSpecimens(specimens);

// Expected process:
// 1. Adjust every 3rd specimen: [5, 8, 4, 12, 7, 16, 2, 9]
//    (positions 2, 5 are incremented: 3→4, 15→16)
// 2. Sort ascending: [2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16]
```

---

## 🔍 Key Implementation Notes

- **Array indexing**: Remember that array indices start at 0
- **Third specimen identification**: Elements at indices 2, 5, 8, 11, etc.
- **Sorting method**: Use appropriate sorting algorithms for numerical data
- **Data integrity**: Ensure original data types are maintained

---

## 🏛️ Museum Context

This sorting system helps museum curators:
- **Organize specimens** by size for easy retrieval
- **Account for preservation effects** on specimen measurements  
- **Facilitate research** by providing consistent data ordering
- **Maintain collection standards** across different specimen types
