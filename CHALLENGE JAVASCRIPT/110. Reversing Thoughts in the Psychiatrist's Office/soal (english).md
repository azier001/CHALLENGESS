# 🧠 Reversing Thoughts in the Psychiatrist's Office

> **Challenge Level:** `Easy` 

## 📋 Overview

In a psychiatrist's office on a gloomy day, a patient expresses their concerns. The psychiatrist decides to help the patient gain a new perspective by reversing their thoughts. Your task is to implement this thought-reversal process that symbolizes a shift in perspective and deeper introspection.

## 🎯 Challenge Description

Create a function named `reverseThoughts` that performs a **double reversal** on the patient's thoughts:

1. **Reverse the order of words** in the sentence
2. **Reverse the characters within each word**

This double reversal represents a therapeutic technique to help patients view their thoughts from a completely different angle.

## 📝 Function Specification

### Function Signature
```javascript
function reverseThoughts(patientThoughts)
```

### Parameters
- **`patientThoughts`** _(string)_: A string representing the patient's thoughts containing one or more words separated by spaces.

### Return Value
- **Returns:** A string representing the reversed thoughts after applying the double reversal technique.

## 🔧 Implementation Requirements

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Split** the input string into an array of words
2. **Reverse** the order of words in the array
3. **Reverse** the characters within each word
4. **Join** the reversed words back into a single string

### ⚠️ Important Constraints

> **Note:** Do not use any built-in reverse functions. You must implement your own reversal logic for both:
> - Word order reversal
> - Character reversal within words

## 💡 Example Usage

```javascript
// Input
reverseThoughts("I feel anxious today")

// Process:
// 1. Split: ["I", "feel", "anxious", "today"]
// 2. Reverse word order: ["today", "anxious", "feel", "I"]
// 3. Reverse characters in each word: ["yadot", "suoixna", "leef", "I"]
// 4. Join: "yadot suoixna leef I"

// Output
"yadot suoixna leef I"
```

## 🎨 Therapeutic Metaphor

The double reversal technique serves as a powerful metaphor:

- **Word Order Reversal**: Represents looking at the situation from the end result back to the beginning
- **Character Reversal**: Symbolizes examining each thought component in detail from a new perspective
- **Combined Effect**: Creates a completely transformed viewpoint that may reveal hidden insights

## 🏆 Success Criteria

Your implementation should:

- ✅ Handle single and multiple words correctly
- ✅ Implement custom reversal logic (no built-in reverse functions)
- ✅ Preserve spacing between words
- ✅ Work with any valid string input
- ✅ Return the properly formatted reversed thoughts
